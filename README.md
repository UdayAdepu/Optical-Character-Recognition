# Optical-Character-Recognition
We a Machine Learning model using the dataset downloaded from an open-source.
We adjusted the pixel resolution and size of the images and turned it to grayscale. 
We used Machine Learning model called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
We used python (Google Colab) for developing the code. 
When the target image is given to the model, it returned output as machine editable text along with probability.
